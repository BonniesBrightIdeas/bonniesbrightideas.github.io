                <h6 class="teal">REDLINING</h6>
                <p>We began with an heuristic evaluation of <a href="https://elihome.org/" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;"> www.elihome.org</a>website. There were inconsistencies in font use and color choice. What the nonprofit did wasn’t clear, and some of the social media icons were out dated. We had no idea why Pinterest was being used. Overall, the website didn’t look professional which also made it somewhat untrustworthy.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the content, we did learn more about the organization but some areas where very overwhelming with paragraphs of text. The navigation broke when we went mobile and the search altogether disappeared. We also didn’t know why certain links didn’t fall under the appropriate drop-downs like “Children of Addicts Recovery Program” under “Programs”. There was alaso a “balloons” section that seemed out of place. On top of everything the loading time was extremely slow.</p>
                <p>Overall, there was a lot of room for improvement and the website left a lot to be desired. </p>
                <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/f6adb244-6641-4beb-a5ce-b905cbe20d87-a3fe/?fullscreen"><p>Check out the screenshoots of the original Eli Home Website. Click here.</p></a>
            </div>
            <div data-aos="fade-up">
                <h6 class="teal">THE HYPOTHESIS</h6>
                <p>It is hypothesized that the majority of. people who visit the Eli Home website have not heard of the organization nor knows what the organization does. The unorganized website without why the organization exists, what the organization does and how the organization does their works will deter people from. donating. By restructuring the website to focus on why Eli Home is needed, what they do, and how they do it, people will be more likely to donate and support the organization. </p>
                <p>This will be tested by further research to clearly define the problem(s) to create a solution(s). Testing will take place throughout the process with wireframes and prototypes of the redesigned Eli Home website. The hypothesis will be deemed true if the results show feedback from people fully understanding the organization and how their donation can make an impact. </p>
            </div>
            <div data-aos="fade-up">
                <h6 class="teal">COLLECTING THE DATA</h6>
                <p>A competitive analysis of other nonprofit organizations relating to children indicate that it is absolutely necessary for Eli Home to have a great online presence. The first impression really matters to gain attention. The common theme and strength of each of the competitors is that their message is clear and their needs are clear. Eli Home will need to meet and exceed those standards if they hope to gain attention and support for their oraganization.</p>
                <p>Upon interviewing Lorri Galloway, the Executive Director, it was indicated that the donations are integral for the organization to fund their programs. With the beginning of closures due to Covid-19, they were having a difficult time adjusting from previously hosting live seasonal social events. Realization that they now have to rely on virtual events also brought the need to update their website to be relevant and attract donations. </p>
                <p>We began by obtaining feedback from the original Eli Home Website with family, friends, and classmates with a total of 10 participants to answer simple questions and complete simple tasks. We wanted to discover what people’s initial reactions to the website were, if they could tell what the organization did, if they would donate, and if they could tell where their money would go. Along with a survey, we used an affinity diagram to gain key insights. </p>

                <p data-aos="slide-right">The user insights revealed that the majority of people made judgments about the nonprofit’s credibility based on the first impression. They were less likely to engage and donate to a nonprofit that didn’t look professional, had unclear needs, and didn’t show how donations are spent. It helped to empathize with the user. </p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">The problem was www.elihome.org was designed to achieve easy access to information about the nonprofit to engage and drive donations. What existed wasn’t achieving its intended purpose causing loss of opportunity. </p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">To create value, the Eli Home website needed to have the best first impression. To do that the navigation needed to improve, the design needed to be cohesive, and layout of content had to make sense. The nonprofit’s message had to shine in showcasing their commitment to the community and the good that they have done in the 37 years they have been open.</p>

                    <p data-aos="slide-right">It was extremely important to simplify the navigation. In open card sorting, the main categories were redefined to provide an overview of the nonprofit as a whole.</p>
                    <p data-aos="slide-right">The appropriate user flow was created to begin the focus of the design. In an ideal situation a user would find important information on the homepage, understand the nonprofit’s need, how their money will be spent, and want to donate.</p>
                    <p data-aos="slide-right">The wireframe provided an outline. In the hopes of meeting all the user needs in order to engage and gain donation, the homepage redesign consisted of a new navigation, using a hero image to create an impact with the focus on the donate button, a banner presenting a child abuse fact, and success stories.</p>
                    <p data-aos="slide-right">Working on the initial design included deciding how to work with the original logo and including the light teal color. With A/B testing different variations were presented and the most engaging was chosen by users. </p>

                <p>The usability testing produced a need for iterations including changing up the logo in the header and removing the donate button, the footer was simplified further, and some content was rearranged to fill the space more appropriately. </p>
                <p>Larger issues to consider was the display of the retail page. Even after the redesign users still found it confusing. It was back to the drawing board. I needed to consider how to keep it simple and yet still present the discount and online product store.</p>
                <p>The remaining obstacle was the color feedback. The original color pallet just didn’t meet user approval. Much deliberation was made before settling on the final selection.</p>

The blue and green properties provided a calming effect that represents communication and clarity of thought. As the color of Eli Home, it represents the organization well in its effort to provide shelter, comfort, heal, encourage and strengthen victims of child abuse. </p>
                    <p>The addition of Sunray provided an energetic, youthful, and bright mood that represent the child.</p>

                <p>Working with a nonprofit had challenges, especially in trying to merry the needs of the organization with expectations of users. The logo didn’t receive positive reviews nor did the teal but it meant a lot to the nonprofit and represented hope for victims in the shelters. Although the purpose of the website was to drive donations its reaches went far beyond just that.</p>
                <p>As a point of light and a beacon of hope, I could empathize with the nonprofit, the people they helped, and the users. I knew the pain points that needed resolutions from the research and with each step in the process the website become clearer from wireframe through creating a style guide. </p>
                <p>After presenting the hi-fidelity design to Eli Home, I hope to obtain the feedback necessary to either continue iterating or move onto development. </p>
