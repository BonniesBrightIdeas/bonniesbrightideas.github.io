                <p data-aos="fade-up">The Eli Home is a nonprofit that has three main areas of service surrounding children. It is a shelter, provides education, and aids in addiction recovery. Having been in operation for 38 years, they have excelled at what they do and are a pillar in the underserved community they serve. </p>
                <h4 data-aos="fade-up" class="margintop">CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p data-aos="fade-up">It’s no secret that COVID-19 has profoundly impacted nonprofits. The Eli Home is one among many nonprofits that has had to stay positive despite a challenging operating and fundraising environment with cancelled events and loss of funders/partners. With the shift to a virtual environment, it’s become clear that The Eli Home’s existing website and web presence was deterring potential donors rather than engaging them.</p>
                <h4 data-aos="fade-up" class="margintop">MY ROLE</h4>
                <p data-aos="fade-up">As the UX/UI Designer, I designed the user research to meet the needs of the organization and created the visual design. I also fully developed the website with content management capabilities before handing it off.</p>

                <p>Working with a nonprofit had challenges, especially during Covid. There were a lot of varying opinions and thoughts to work through. Everyone wanted to have a say so it was important to keep in mind and allow the reasearch to speak for itself. </p>
                <p>Having carte blanche was a fun and rare opportunity to be creative; however, I knew my design would be edited so I allowed it to showcase what was possible. It took a lot of testing to finally get the right look, feel, and functionality.</p> 
                <p>Their trust in me also let me develop the website for them and even moved them from Wordpress to Webflow. With improved content management capabilities, they were thrilled with the possibilities.</p>
                <p>With moving their fundraising and other events virtually, they now have a platform that can keep up and really showcase their work and success professionally. </p>
                <p>As I wrap up, there may be future opportunities to enhance their volunteer application submission and incoporate a functional form that is fully responsive.</p>
