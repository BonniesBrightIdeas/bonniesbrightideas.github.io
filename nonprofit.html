                <h6 class="teal">REDLINING</h6>
                <p>In the heuristic evaluation of <a href="https://elihome.org/" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;"> www.elihome.org</a>, it was clear that there was no consistent design and the choice of text didn’t present the nonprofit as professional. The hero images were varied in size so it didn’t fit the allotted boundary properly. The content was easy to scan but some pages had lengthy paragraphs.</p>
                <p>The logo in the header navigation took up way too much space and categories were broken into two lines depending on screen size.  On the mobile screen ,the search icon disappeared completely. There was one broken social media links and one social media selection that didn’t serve any purpose nor was it related to the message of Eli Home. </p>
                <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/f6adb244-6641-4beb-a5ce-b905cbe20d87-a3fe/?fullscreen"><p>Check out the redline annotations. Click here.</p></a>

            <div>
                <h6 class="teal">THE HYPOTHESIS</h6>
                <p>It is hypothesized that people who visit the existing website generally have not heard of Eli Home, they don’t know how the money donated is spent and what programs are offered. By restructuring and rebranding the website to focus on the needs of Eli Home, it will help raise awareness for child abuse and need for support. </p>
                <p> This will be tested by further research, defining the problem, creating solutions, and testing the prototype of the redesigned website. The hypothesis will be deemed true if the results show feedback of users understanding the nonprofit’s message, needs, and how the money donated will be spent.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h6 class="teal">COLLECTING THE DATA</h6>
                <p>A competitive analysis of other organizations indicated that it is necessary for Eli Home to overhaul their website to have a good online presence and improve credibility. Good design and the first impression really matters. The message needs to be clear and needs of the organization evident. </p>
                <p>Upon interviewing Lorri Galloway, the Executive Director, it was indicated that the donations typically raised from hosting quarterly events were non-existent due to Covid-19. They were having a difficult time adjusting so they had to rely on their discount store and online home products store to generate funds to continue their programs. They, more than ever, needed their website to attract donors by showcasing the work they do.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 70px;">The user testing and survey provided additional information which were compiled in an affinity diagram to gain key insights. </p>

                <p data-aos="slide-right">The user insights revealed that the majority of people made judgments about the nonprofit’s credibility based on the first impression. They were less likely to engage and donate to a nonprofit that didn’t look professional, had unclear needs, and didn’t show how donations are spent. It helped to empathize with the user. </p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">The problem was www.elihome.org was designed to achieve easy access to information about the nonprofit to engage and drive donations. What existed wasn’t achieving its intended purpose causing loss of opportunity. </p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">To create value, the Eli Home website needed to have the best first impression. To do that the navigation needed to improve, the design needed to be cohesive, and layout of content had to make sense. The nonprofit’s message had to shine in showcasing their commitment to the community and the good that they have done in the 37 years they have been open.</p>

                <p data-aos="slide-right">It was extremely important to simplify the navigation. In open card sorting, the main categories were redefined to provide an overview of the nonprofit as a whole.</p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">The appropriate user flow was created to begin the focus of the design. In an ideal situation a user would find important information on the homepage, understand the nonprofit’s need, how their money will be spent, and want to donate.</p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">The wireframe provided an outline. In the hopes of meeting all the user needs in order to engage and gain donation, the homepage redesign consisted of a new navigation, using a hero image to create an impact with the focus on the donate button, a banner presenting a child abuse fact, and success stories.</p>
                <p data-aos="slide-right">Working on the initial design included deciding how to work with the original logo and including the light teal color. With A/B testing different variations were presented and the most engaging was chosen by users. </p>

            <p>The usability testing produced a need for iterations including changing up the logo in the header and removing the donate button, the footer was simplified further, and some content was rearranged to fill the space more appropriately. </p>
            <p>Larger issues to consider was the display of the retail page. Even after the redesign users still found it confusing. It was back to the drawing board. I needed to consider how to keep it simple and yet still present the discount and online product store.</p>
            <p>The remaining obstacle was the color feedback. The original color pallet just didn’t meet user approval. Much deliberation was made before settling on the final selection.</p>

The blue and green properties provided a calming effect that represents communication and clarity of thought.

                <p>The addition of Sunray provided an energetic, youthful, and bright mood that represent the child.</p>

                <p>Working with a nonprofit had challenges, especially in trying to merry the needs of the organization with expectations of users. The logo didn’t receive positive reviews nor did the teal but it meant a lot to the nonprofit and represented hope for victims in the shelters. Although the purpose of the website was to drive donations its reaches went far beyond just that.</p>
                <p>As a point of light and a beacon of hope, I could empathize with the nonprofit, the people they helped, and the users. I knew the pain points that needed resolutions from the research and with each step in the process the website become clearer from wireframe through creating a style guide. </p>
                <p>After presenting the hi-fidelity design to Eli Home, I hope to obtain the feedback necessary to either continue iterating or move onto development. </p>
