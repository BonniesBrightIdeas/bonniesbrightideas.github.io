            <p>We began our reserach by creating a proto-persona. We wanted to have a clear picture of who we were trying to reach so we could appropriately build our process on how we could properly obtain data. We gathered our collective knowledge, information from the media, friends with kids grades K-12, and teachers to visualize Carolina who represented all the parents struggling to balance life with work, family, and covid. 
            <br><br>
            We held interviews to understand users’ motivations and needs on a qualatative level moving education from a physical classroom to a virtual classroom. Our goal was to gather how were parents, students, and teachers were handling the change in daily routines, navigating resources, and handling tech issues.
            <br><br>
            As the interviews took place, it was surprising to learn that covid-related information wasn’t lacking nor were tech issues were of concern. We could see how passionate parents were about creating a nurturing environment for their children in how they responded. We could also hear the stress and frustration in their voices as they spoke about their expereince juggling with the new role of at-hom teacher.
            <br><br>
            We took the opportunity to go deeper with a survey that would provide quantitive data to support data we had already collected from the interviews.

            <p>Each response was analyized and placed on a card that could be sorted in an affinity diagram which not only provided insights but allowed us to fully empathize with our users. We then created an empathy map and begin to get to the root of the problem.
            <br><br>
            The problem was that remote learning has diminished the supportive school environment previously provided to students causing immense stress for both partents and students.
            <br><br>
            Parents are stressed by the lack of time, teaching resources, and supportive community.
            <br><br>  
            Students are constrained in their physical, social, and developmental needs.
            <br><br> 
            How were we going to overcomesome such massive obstacles? Originally, we had reviewed the Los Angeles Unified School District website but we realized that wasn’t where there was a need, even though there were issues with the usability and the design left a lot to be desired. We reevaluated our research and decided we could make the most impact at the school level. We selected West Hollywood Elementary School to redesign. Parents  and student were logging into virtual classrooms through the school website. They weren’t even visiting at district website in nearly all cases. We backtracked slightly and completed a new heuristic evalution and annotation of the West Hollywood Elementary School website. Aesthetically it wasn’t appealing, there seemed to be so much content that it was cluttered, there were videos all over the page, and the call to action was difficult to percevie.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>We were ready to ideate. The issue we wanted to address foremost was the lack of mentoring support. How could we best support parents with teaching and provide a tool for students? We decided on creating a new feature that was a virtual learning hub. Parents could use it to watch lessons recorded during virtual classes to better understand the content and in turn help their children by explaining the content in another way. This would alleviate parents from wasting time on youtube or google trying to find answers.
            <br><br>
            We created a user scenario to help determine the best plan of action and storyboarded our idea. We were ready to card sort and implement this new feature as part of the redesign.

            <p>Begining with the wireframe, we tried various layouts to highlight the new features. We wanted the homepage to be easily navigated with clear sections to minize the clutter and overwhelming look of the original website. 
            <br><br>
            We purposefully kept it simple. Due to time constraints we were not able to test. We moved right into high fidelity mockups. Each of us had varying ideas so it was unanimously decided that we would each present, recevie critique and move forward with the best design. 
            <br><br>
            We chose the one that that emot happiness and youth yet was still professional. We made adjustments and updated the content. It was one of the rare occassions that we could choose a font similar to comic sans without appearing unprofessional.

                        Once the protype came together we could start the usability testing and obtain valuable feedback from users. It lead us to iterate on our prototype three more times. It was improtant to get it right.  Our usability test revealed that there wasn’t a clear call to action with the sliding hero images. They also wanted consistancy in lining up elements rather than an artistic flare. Also, the cards needed more context. Users didn’t really know what they were getting or if they should click on the card button.

                    <p>Once ready to Front-end develop, I chose to challenge myself and used bootstrap 4. It did come with some struggles due to how artistically we had redesigned the website. I had to learn to manipulate and over-ride to customize it the way we had designed. With the help of Brian, I was able to build out the main virtual learning hub user flow. </p>

            <p>I’m always searching for new and creative ways to tackle the problems and challenges. Sometimes, it isn’t enough to follow just one approach because innovation is a process. We had to be considerate of our time frame with only two weeks, so selecting an attainable goal was key. We couldn’t solve every problem with one go, as ambitious as we were. Communicating effectively made for smooth work. We were able to utilize each individual’s strengths and trust each other which that lead to successfully meeting our deadline and presenting our work.</p>
